# AdventOfCode2023

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for various skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language.

It has helped me fall in love with programming once more!

Two Christmas-themed :christmas_tree: programming problems are uploaded every day, and participants get to compete on global and private leaderboards too.
